=== Enhancement Added: Find a person via the contact tags

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=findtag]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The address book had tags for each contact, however there was no way to search for contact with certain tags.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=findtag]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Locate a person

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=locate]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

May help the user finding the contact address quickly and perhaps direction if the user want to go there.

==== Implementation

Similar to select command but load a google map page instead.

=== Enhancement Added: Event functionality

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=event]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=reminder]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The application is also meant to be a task manager. Thus there is a need to implement task/event functionality.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=taskevent]


#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Change application css theme

==== Justification

Original DarkTheme color looked dull and uninspired for a user end product.
