__NeoxPro Manager is everything you need__

* This is a desktop contact and event manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* Users can keep track of their friends' information details and availability, upcoming events, and more.
* With the app alert system, you will never miss or forget an important near future event again.
